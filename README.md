### <div align="center"> ü§î _Description:_

The "Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood number replacement" is a web application that takes a user-inputted number and generates a list of values from 0 to the provided number, each with unique substitutions:

* Numbers containing the digit 1 will have all their digits replaced with "Beep!"
(e.g., 109, 11, or 1 become "Beep!")

* Numbers containing the digit 2 will have all their digits replaced with "Boop!"
(e.g., 2, 24, or 2099 become "Boop!")

* Numbers containing the digit 3 will have all their digits replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
(e.g., 39, 3, or 8763 become "Won't you be my neighbor?")
